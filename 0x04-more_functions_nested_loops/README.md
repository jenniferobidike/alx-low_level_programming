0-isupper.c: C function that checks for uppercase characters. Returns 1 if the character is uppercase, 0 otherwise.

1-isdigit.c: C function that checks for a digit (0 through 9). Returns 1 if the character is a digit, 0 otherwise.

2-mul.c: C function that multiplies two integers. Returns the value of the multiplication.

3-print_numbers.c: C function that prints the numbers 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4-print_most_numbers: C function that prints the numbers 0 to 9 except for 2 and 4, followed by a new line.

5-more_numbers.c: C function that prints the numbers 0 to 14, followed by a new line, ten times.

6-print_line.c: C function that draws a straight line in the terminal using the character _, followed by a new line.
If the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

7-print_diagonal.c: C function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal using the \ character, followed by a new line.
If the function receives length input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

8-print_square.c: C function that prints a square using the # character, followed by a new line.
If the function receives size input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

9-fizz_buzz.c: The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
Each number or word should be separated by a space

10-print_triangle.c: C function that prints a triangle using the # character, followed by a new line.
If the function receives size input of zero or less, only a new line is printed.

11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic
100-prime_factor.c: C program that prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper
101-print_number.c: C function that prints an integer without using long, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded special values.
